                                    The Vines are an Australian rock band formed in 1994 in Sydney.
                                    Their sound has been described as a musical hybrid of 1960s garage rock and 1990s alternative rock.
                                    The band's current line-up consists of vocalist and guitarist Craig Nicholls, bass guitarist Tim John and drummer Lachlan West.

                                    The Vines' success in the Australian recording industry resulted in winning an ARIA Award in 2002,
                                    'Breakthrough Artist – Single', for "Get Free" and receiving five other nominations for their debut album Highly Evolved,
                                    plus two further nominations in subsequent years. In 2003, the album went platinum in Australia, and since then the band has released
                                    four albums and a best-of compilation from their time at Capitol Records. The Vines have released six studio albums to date.

                                    Sick Puppies is an Australian rock band, formed in 1997. Sick Puppies rose to prominence in 2006 when their song "All the Same" was uploaded,
                                    along with a video, to YouTube. The video supported the Free Hugs Campaign, which was launched in Sydney, and has since received over 77 million
                                    views on the website. This success was followed up with Dressed Up as Life in 2007, which entered the Billboard 200 at number 181.
                                    Their third studio album, Tri-Polar, came out on 14 July 2009. The band's fourth studio album, Connect was released on 16 July 2013.
                                    They released their fifth studio album, Fury on 20 May 2016 with new vocalist Bryan Scott after Shimon Moore left the band in October 2014.

                                    Sneaky Sound System is an Australian dance music group formed in late 2001 by Black Angus (Angus McDonald) on guitar,
                                    MC Double D (Daimon Downey) on vocoder and vocals, Damien Hesse (DJ) and Nick Broadhurst on saxophone.
                                    They were joined in 2004 by Connie Mitchell (ex-Primary) on vocals; Downey left the band in September 2009,
                                    Hesse in 2005 and Broadhurst in 2006. On 12 August 2006, they released their self-titled debut studio album,
                                    which peaked at No. 5 on the ARIA Albums Chart in mid-November 2007 and was certified 3× platinum by December 2011,
                                    denoting shipments of 210,000 copies. The group's breakthrough single, "I Love It", which was issued on 8 July 2006,
                                    peaked at No. 24 on the ARIA Singles Chart and spent 73 weeks in the Top 100 – this broke the record as the longest
                                    charting single previously held by The Living End's 1997 hit, "Second Solution / Prisoner of Society", at 69 weeks.
                                    Their second studio effort, 2, which appeared on 16 August 2008, became their first number-one album.
                                    On 7 October 2011, From Here to Anywhere was released and reached at No. 11. At ARIA Music Awards ceremonies they have been nominated
                                    fourteen times winning twice in 2007 for Best Dance Release and Breakthrough Artist – Album for their eponymous album.

                                    The Presets are an electronic music duo consisting of Australian musicians Julian Hamilton (vocals, keyboards) and Kim Moyes (drums, keyboards).
                                    Formed in 2003 and signed to Modular Records, The Presets released two EPs (Blow Up, Girl and the Sea) in advance of their debut album, Beams,
                                    released in 2005 to positive critical response. After two years of touring, including as the Australian support for Daft Punk,
                                    the band's 2008 release, Apocalypso, debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart, and went on to win six awards at ARIA Awards 2008, including Album of the Year.

                                    In 2009 Hamilton and Moyes won an APRA Award for Songwriters of the Year and another ARIA Award, this time for Best Dance Release for
                                    "Talk Like That". They released their third album, Pacifica, in Australia in September 2012. It reached No. 3 on the ARIA Albums Chart.
                                    The Presets are known for their dynamic live shows.

                                    Aside from the Presets' extensive performance work, the duo has remixed tracks for several other artists including Kings of Leon,
                                    Silverchair and Lenny Kravitz. The Presets are recognized as key players in the dance music explosion in Australia in the late 2000s.

                            Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States in the early 1950s, and developed into
                            a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and in the United States.
                            It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style which drew heavily on the African-American genres of blues and rhythm and blues,
                            and from country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz,
                            classical and other musical styles. Musically, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass and drums and one or more singers.
                            Typically, rock is song-based music usually with a 4/4 time signature using a verse–chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music,
                            lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political. <br><br>

                            By the late 1960s "classic rock" period, a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, raga rock,
                            and jazz-rock, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock, which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene.
                            New genres that emerged included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements; glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style; and the diverse
                            and enduring subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed. In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down,
                            energetic social and political critiques. Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave, post-punk and eventually alternative rock. From the 1990s alternative rock
                            began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged, including pop punk,
                            electronic rock, rap rock, and rap metal, as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history, including the garage rock/post-punk and techno-pop revivals at the beginning of the 2000s.

                            Rock music has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements, leading to major subcultures including mods and rockers in the UK and the hippie counterculture
                            that spread out from San Francisco in the US in the 1960s. Similarly, 1970s punk culture spawned the goth, punk, and emo subcultures.
                            Inheriting the folk tradition of the protest song, rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social attitudes to race, sex and drug use,
                            and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult consumerism and conformity.

                            Pop rock (also typeset as pop/rock) is rock music with a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft, and less emphasis on attitude.
                            Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo-wop).
                            It may be viewed as a distinct genre field, rather than music that overlaps with pop and rock. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product,
                            less authentic than rock music.

                            Much pop and rock music has been very similar in sound, instrumentation and even lyrical content. The terms "pop rock" and "power pop" have been used
                            to describe more commercially successful music that uses elements from, or the form of, rock music. Writer Johan Fornas views pop/rock as "one single, continuous genre field",
                            rather than distinct categories. To the authors Larry Starr and Christopher Waterman, it is defined as an "upbeat variety of rock music" represented by artists and bands such as:
                            Andy Kim, the Bells, Paul McCartney, Lighthouse, and Peter Frampton.

                            The term pop has been used since the early twentieth century to refer to popular music in general, but from the mid-1950s it began to be used for a distinct genre,
                            aimed at a youth market, often characterized as a softer alternative to rock and roll. In the aftermath of the British Invasion, from about 1967,
                            it was increasingly used in opposition to the term rock music, to describe a form that was more commercial, ephemeral and accessible.

                            Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Originally used to describe independent record labels,
                            the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with "alternative rock". As grunge and punk revival bands in the US,
                            and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective.
                            In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success,
                            leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.

                            Sometimes used interchangeably with "guitar pop rock", in the mid-1980s, the term "indie" (or "indie pop") began to be used to describe the music produced on punk
                            and post-punk labels.Some prominent indie rock record labels were founded during the 1980s. During the 1990s, Grunge bands broke into the mainstream,
                            and the term "alternative" lost its original counter-cultural meaning. The term "indie rock" became associated with the bands and genres
                            that remained dedicated to their independent status. By the end of the 1990s indie rock developed subgenres and related styles including lo-fi,
                            noise pop, emo, slowcore, post-rock and math rock.In the 2000s, changes in the music industry and in music technology enabled a new wave
                            of indie rock bands to achieve mainstream success.

                            In the early 2000s, a new group of bands that played a stripped-down and back-to-basics version of guitar rock emerged into the mainstream.
                            The commercial breakthrough from these scenes was led by four bands: The Strokes, The White Stripes, The Hives and The Vines.
                            Emo also broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s. By the end of the 2000s the proliferation of indie bands was being referred to as "indie landfill".
